name: Pass-Fail Gate
description: |
  This script blocks the pipeline flow, asking the user to validate the intermediate results.
  If the user approves, the flow of the pipeline will continue.
  If the user rejects, this stops the pipeline.

  Note that for pipelines with parallel branches, this will not stop other parallel branches from executing while waiting for the user's input.
  (Cannot be ran as a single script.)
